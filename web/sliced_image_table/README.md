Two examples that show how to layout a sliced image, one with a table and one with DIVs. It's recommended not to use the table version because the HTML5 specification of the [The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG)](http://whatwg.org) explicitly says that **[tables must not be used as layout aids](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/tabular-data.html#the-table-element)**. Have a look at [The CSS table model](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#table-display).
